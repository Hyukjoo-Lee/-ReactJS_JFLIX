## Project Review

- First of all, the great advantage of react-query is really fast and useful when I fetch data with a few lines of code. 
- It reduces the amount of code instead of using the useState several times. 
- Especially caching feature, which allowed me to load and utilize data fetched by API.
- Through the experience, I got used to designing animation with the framer-motion library; It helped me to build a lively web.
- I am planning to add more functions; add favourites, review & rating system .. etc.
